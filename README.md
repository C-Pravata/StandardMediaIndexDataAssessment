Excel file  contains monthly data for some of the companies we capture within our data pool. There are two spreadsheets within the file; one titled “Year over Year (YOY) Trends” and the other titled “Data Issues – Oct’21 vs. Nov’21.”

 
One of the responsibilities of this role is to analyze how the data is trending and call out any potential signals in our monthly data. So, on the first spreadsheet “Year over Year (YOY) Trends,” we would like you to review the monthly data for Meta Platforms and Twitter for any interesting YOY growth rates. Our clients tend to focus on our monthly data as this provides real-time insight into if a company’s quarterly ad revenue is accelerating or decelerating, so it’s important to call out any YOY trends in the monthly data where it shifts positively/negatively or differs from expected patterns. Can you please review the monthly data and share any instances/months with intriguing YOY trends?


On the second spreadsheet “Data Issues – Oct’21 vs. Nov’21,” we would like you to review the monthly data for our November 2021 release for any potential anomalies or data issues, when compared to the prior month’s data release (October 2021.) I understand this is your first time viewing the data and you are not familiar with the nuances of how our data changes each release, so I’ve shared some expectations and ranges for how we expect the data to reconcile each monthly release. Could you please review each company’s data for Nov’2021, and call out any potential anomalies or errors you find suspicious when comparing it against the data we previously released (Oct’2021)?

Expectations of Monthly reconciliations are below:

The monthly data that tends to change the most each release is the last 3 months of data we released. In those months, we expect the data to reconcile +/- by low single digits (%). All other historical data should be either static or should reconcile by ~0%.
Also, assume we haven’t done any data cleansing where the data needed to have historical $’s added or removed.
